# Plant-Disease-Prediction-with-CNN-Image-Classifier_Deeplearning-Project
Plant Disease Prediction with CNN Image Classifier Project

Project Overview:
This repository is about building an Image classifier CNN with Python on Plant Disease Prediction.
This project aims to build a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for predicting plant diseases using images. The model is trained on the PlantVillage dataset, which contains images of various plant leaves labeled with the type of disease or as healthy.
